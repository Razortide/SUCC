## [Unreleased]  

## [0.1.0-pre.2] - 2022-02-25
**Make peace please!**
### Added
- Smite Builder: When applying the Smite condition, a dialogue is prompted that allows the player to select a weapon and a number. The AE will then be set up to add the number to the weapons damage modifier. It also sets the duration to 5 and prompts a dialogue asking to remove it after it expires.
- Protection Builder: When applying the Protection condition, a dialogue is prompted, that allows the player to select a number. The AE will then be set up to add that number as armour or toughness (users choice) (expiration and duration works but is already handled by the system).

## [0.1.0-pre] - 2022-02-15
### Added
- Pre-Release with the most basic functionality.
