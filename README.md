# SUCC - SWADE Unlimited Condition Changer

This module is meant to change the condition icons in the SWADE system (v.1+) on Foundry VTT. It will not be customisable until we find the time to do so. For now its main purpose is to provide the features [Combat Utility Belt](https://github.com/death-save/combat-utility-belt) cannot offer to the SWADE system for the time being (since the change of how conditions work and are applied in SWADE v.1+) which I need for [SWIM](https://github.com/SalieriC/SWADE-Immersive-Macros).

## Priotisation roadmap
1. Forced (for now) custom icons for existing status effects and their AEs.
2. Adding new status effects needed in SWIM.
3. Adding output to chat when conditions are applied.
4. Adding Active Effects to conditions.
5. A proper GUI for customisability.

As you can see, customisability is both, low in priority but our ultimate goal. We love customisation but getting a working module done is top priority. Only if it all works as we need it to work, we can start implementing a GUI for non-devs to work with.
